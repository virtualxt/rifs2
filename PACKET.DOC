packet buffer and handshaking...

PACKET
  BYTE  packetID[2] -- KY -- request from server
                       LY -- reply from server
                       RP -- resent last packet, either direction
  WORD  length      -- number of bytes in this packet
                       the entire packet (including header)
  WORD  notlength   -- ~length (used to verify correctness)
  DWORD crc32       -- 32 bit CRC, calculated over the entire packet,
                       with this value set to 0 for the calculation
  WORD  cmd         -- for the server, this is the result of the operation
                       for the client, this is the code of the operation to
                       be performed
  BYTE  data[]      -- any additional data to be sent either direction
-----------------------------------------------------------
a basic assumtion in this is that only request can be processed in either
direction at a time, but requests can go in either direction. if both
directions are going simultaneously, a full packet must be transmitted
in one direction first.
